  ## Description 
NextHire is a sleek app that helps you browse and manage potential developer candidates using real-time data from the GitHub API. Search by GitHub username to view detailed profiles—or let the app surprise you with randomly suggested developers to explore.

## Installation 
If you want to run it locally, here’s what you need to do:
1. Clone or download the repo.
2. Install the required dependencies with ``npm install``
3. Set up your ``.env`` file with your github key
3. Run ``npm run develop`` to start it
4. That’s it! Your app is ready to go — explore and enjoy!


## Usage 
Once the app is up and running—either locally or through the live link—you can start exploring candidates right away.

Flip through randomly suggested developers using the buttons:

✅ Click the green button to save a candidate

❌ Click the red button to skip and see the next one

Looking for someone specific? Just use the search bar at the top to find them by GitHub username.

To view your saved candidates, head over to the Potential Candidates page where you’ll see a table of all the profiles you’ve saved.

That’s it! Simple, smooth, and kinda like a dating app—but for hire seekers
